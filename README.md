# Ensemble Model Script for Text Classification
This script demonstrates how to build an ensemble model using Python and the scikit-learn library for text classification. The data used in this script consists of text articles from five different topics: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. The goal is to build an ensemble model that can classify new articles into one of these topics.
## Overview
Ensemble models are machine learning models that combine the predictions of multiple individual models to create a more accurate and robust prediction. The idea behind ensemble modeling is that by combining the predictions of multiple models, we can overcome the limitations and weaknesses of any one model, and create a more accurate and reliable prediction.

In this script, we will demonstrate how to build an ensemble model for text classification using three common ensemble methods: bagging, boosting, and stacking. We will use scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical features, and then train several individual models on the features before combining their predictions using the ensemble methods.
# Dataset
The dataset consists of text articles from five different topics: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. The dataset can be found: http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html.

The text data will be preprocessed to remove any stop words and non-alphabetic characters, and then converted into numerical features using scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer.
